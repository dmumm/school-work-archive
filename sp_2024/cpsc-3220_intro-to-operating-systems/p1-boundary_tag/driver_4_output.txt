   alloc block 1 at offset 0x610 of size 0x50
release_mem(ptr[1]) returns 0 - 0 expected
ptr[2] gets NULL
release_mem(ptr[2]) returns 1 - 1 expected
   alloc block 3 at offset 0x460 of size 0x200
release_mem(ptr[3]+3) returns 2 - 2 expected
release_mem(ptr[3]) returns 0 - 0 expected
repeat of release_mem(ptr[3]) returns 3 - 3 expected
