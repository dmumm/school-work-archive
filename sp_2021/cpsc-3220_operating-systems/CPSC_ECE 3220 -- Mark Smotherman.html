</li><li> 42% - 3 in-class exams @ 14%
</li><li> 14% - final exam
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>Course Expectations:</b>
</p><ul>
<li> The course will be structured with daily work, projects, and exams.
For class days other than those with in-class exams, the daily work will
typically require you to:
<ul>
<li> Complete readings and prepare written answers for the pre-class
     activities. The purpose is to have you engage with terminology,
     concepts, and methods before you attend class or watch the
     recorded video.
</li><li> Answer additional questions or work problems during the class.
     The purpose is to provide practice with the material and to confirm
     your correct understanding of the material.
</li><li> Complete an after-class quiz based on your pre-class
     preparation and your in-class activities and discussions. The
     purpose is to have you test your understanding prior to an exam.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li> Please wait up to 15 minutes if I am late to class.
<p>
</p></li><li> Exams
<ul>
<li> Any exam that was scheduled at the time of a class cancellation
due to inclement weather, University power outage, etc., will be given
at the next class meeting unless contacted by the instructor. Any
assignments due at the time of a class cancellation due to inclement
weather will be due at the next class meeting unless the instructor
contacts students. Any extension or postponement of assignments or
exams must be granted by the instructor via email or Canvas within
24 hours of the weather-related cancellation.
</li><li> Students may be excused from the final exam when those students
want their final grades to be based on the coursework prior to the
final exam.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li> Programs
<ul>
<li> Programs must run on School of Computing servers. (Your laptop
     may have applications and/or libraries not available on the servers;
     thus, if your program makes use of these, your program cannot be run
     and graded on the servers.)
</li><li> Programs are due just before midnight on the due date.
</li><li> It is your responsibility to submit the correct file(s) in the correct
     format(s). You should check each submitted file for correctness and to
     ensure that it is uncorrupted. Files will be graded as-is, and
     resubmission will not be allowed.
</li><li> Programs that do not compile will receive no credit.
</li><li> Programs that work correctly for a few test cases but not for all
     reasonable inputs will not be given full points. It is your
     responsibility to code correctly for reasonable inputs.
</li><li> Late programs will be accepted but 10 points will be deducted for
     each day late, up to five days. Thus a program that is three days
     late will have a maximum possible point total of 70.
</li><li> Unless otherwise noted, programming is to be individual work.
     Do not discuss the solution to an assignment with anyone else
     (either a class member or someone else). If you have questions,
     ask me in person or by email.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Attendance
<ul>
<li> Daily attendance will not be graded. You are responsible for keeping
up with the daily work (i.e., Pre-Class Activities, In-Class Activities,
and After-Class Quizzes) according to their due dates. Late submission
of daily work without a pre-approved excused absence or without
extenuating circumstances will result in grades of 0 for the daily work.
</li><li> Attendance at exams is expected.  Missing an exam without a
pre-approved excused absence or without extenuating circumstances
will result in a grade of 0 for the exam.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>Drops Days:</b> Drop w/o record by January 20;
drop w/o grade by March 12

<b>Clemson Statement of Academic Integrity:</b>
"As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited
Thomas Green Clemson's vision of this institution as a 'high seminary
of learning.' Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to
truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn
the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic
dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we
shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form."
</p><p>
<b>Work turned in for credit in a previous class:</b>
When appropriate and when fully documented, you may reuse your own work
from a previous class. For example, if you are reusing parts of a program
written for a previous course, add a notice to your program header comments
about the scope of the reuse and the course in which the work was previously
submitted.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
<b>Accessibility Statement:</b>
Clemson University values the diversity of our student body as a
strength and a critical component of our dynamic community. Students
with disabilities or temporary injuries/conditions may require
accommodations due to barriers in the structure of facilities,
course design, technology used for curricular purposes, or other
campus resources. Students who experience a barrier to full access
to a class should let the professor know, and make an appointment
to meet with a staff member in Student Accessibility Services as
soon as possible. You can make an appointment by calling 864-656-6848
or by emailing studentaccess@lists.clemson.edu. Students who receive
Academic Access Letters are strongly encouraged to request, obtain
and present these to their professors as early in the semester as
possible so that accommodations can be made in a timely manner.
It is the student's responsibility to follow this process each
semester. You can access further information here:
http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/campusservices/sds/.

<b>Title IX (Sexual Harassment) Statement:</b>
Clemson University is committed to a policy of equal opportunity
for all persons and does not discriminate on the basis of race,
color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, pregnancy,
national origin, age, disability, veteran's status, genetic
information or protected activity (e.g., opposition to prohibited
discrimination or participation in any complaint process, etc.)
in employment, educational programs and activities, admissions
and financial aid. This includes a prohibition against sexual
harassment and sexual violence as mandated by Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972. The University is committed to
combatting sexual harassment and sexual violence. As a result,
you should know that University faculty and staff members who
work directly with students are required to report any instances
of sexual harassment and sexual violence, to the University's
Title IX Coordinator. What this means is that as your professor,
I am required to report any incidents of sexual harassment,
sexual violence or misconduct, stalking, domestic and/or
relationship violence that are directly reported to me, or of
which I am somehow made aware.
</p><p>
There are two important exceptions to this requirement about
which you should be aware:
</p><ul>
<li> Confidential Resources and facilitators of sexual awareness
programs such as "Take Back the Night" and "Aspire to be Well"
when acting in those capacities, are not required to report
incidents of sexual discrimination.
</li><li> Another important exception to the reporting requirement
exists for academic work. Disclosures about sexual harassment,
sexual violence, stalking, domestic and/or relationship violence
that are shared as part of an academic project, a research project,
classroom discussion, or course assignment, are not required to be
disclosed to the University's Title IX Coordinator.
</li></ul>
This policy is located at
http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/campus-services/access/title-ix/.
Ms. Alesia Smith is the Executive Director for Equity Compliance and
the Title IX Coordinator. Her office is located at 223 Holtzendorff Hall,
phone number is 864.656.3181, and email address is alesias@clemson.edu. 
<p>
</p><hr>
<p>
<b>Academic Continuity Plan for this Class:</b>
Clemson has developed an academic continuity plan for academic operations.
Should University administration officially determine that the physical
classroom facility is not available, class will be conducted in a virtual
(online) format. The University issues official disruption notifications
through email/www/test notification/social media. When notified, use one
of the following links to navigate for Clemson Canvas, where you will find
important information about how we will conduct class:
</p><ul>
<li> Primary access link: www.clemson.edu/canvas
</li><li> Secondary access link, if needed: https://clemson.instructure.com/
</li><li> You can also use the Canvas Student App. 
</li></ul>
Our activities for teaching and learning will occur through our Canvas
course. This includes assignments and submissions.
<p>
</p><hr>
<p>
<b>Note:</b>
The course syllabus is a general plan for the course. I reserve the right
to make changes to the syllabus, including project due dates and in-class
exam dates, when unforeseen circumstances occur. I will announce any
changes as early as possible so that you can adjust your schedule.
I will not make changes arbitrarily. Instead, I will work to design any
changes so that we can still meet the course learning outcomes without
putting you at a disadvantage.
