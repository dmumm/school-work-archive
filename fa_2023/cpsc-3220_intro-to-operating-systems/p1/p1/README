Short description: leakcount utilizes memory_shim.so to record any dynamic memory
                    allocations, then any freeing of those allocations, to then print out
                    any memory leakes found.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

* no sctracer (uhh i thought this was due friday and was trying too hard on those arg parsing...)
* limited portability, being highly reliant on a fairly recent and comprehensive linux install
* doesn't seem to be properly calculating absolute paths or programs in $PATH, granted it did in wsl2 ubuntu 22
* in my wsl2 install it would also work without any ld_preload instructions and im not sure why

DESIGN:

* tried using popen() initially but could not get ld_preload working on the lab computer so i switched to the current implementation which I believe broke some things
* very close to good argument handling...honestly quite confused as to why there isn't better libraries
* on my install I initially had a much more organized repo with the makefile but then I realized that was against the rules
* i spent eeons on double and triple pointers as well as trying to figure out how to properly const them
    * gave up on the consts when i realized you would need absurd declarations like `char const * const ** const * var`, but only after i tried to way too long to create a typedef scheme that encoded a naming scheme with mutability values of each typedef possibility (dozens)
* also tried way too long trying to fix bugs regarding not properly dereferencing pointers to matrices
    * eg (*pSubjectArg)[i] instead of *pSubjectArg[i]
* also spent like a day on popen() not working that I thought was my vscode / wsl, but rather i forgot about gnu_source
    * again, thought it was due friday....
    * learned a ton about clang-tidy and its integration with vscode and Makefile Tools though
* also learned about the `argv, 10` notation in the vscode w/ gdb debugger, immense help

ANY MATERIALS:

* honestly like hundreds of stack overflows and reddit posts i didn't really organize, many of which went no where. if you want I could export browser history just don't have time right now
