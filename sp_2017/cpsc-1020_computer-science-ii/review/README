Your goal for this example is to:

1. Create the Banana class which is a derived class of Fruit
	a. The Banana class has a unique property called "isRipe", which is a boolean
	b. Use the Apple class as an example, making sure to implement the ostream operator

2. Complete the FruitStand class, which has a collection of fruits and helper methods
		and an overloaded ostream operator. See FruitStand.hpp and FruitStand.cpp

3. In the driver, add some fruits to the stand and see if it works.
