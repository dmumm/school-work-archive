My problems were mostly about starting from scratch, made it real intimidating
to begin the project, and then made it difficult to formulate a real plan of action,
and overall structure of the program

I combined PA2 and our inheritance labs to give me an idea where to start

My second problem was I always print this weird shade of green and I can't figure
out why

I liked the assignment overall though
