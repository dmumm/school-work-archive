1. My main problem was just wrapping my head around the intersection of
   functions, structs, pointers, and malloc. My biggest problem by far was to
   get my image properly read and passed into my 2d array, as if you can't get
   that completed its very hard to progress onto the rest of the functions

2. I primarily got my way through it via trying over and over again and slowly
   reducing my amount of errors and warnings until it worked. I never solved my
   issue with readImage

3. I really liked the assignment. Ample time, a great way to learn the concepts,
   and pretty fun. My issues with it were completely my fault for failing to
   pay attention to malloc and pointers in class and falling behind on the labs,
   and then procrastinating on this project until the last weekend when I was
   already so behind.
