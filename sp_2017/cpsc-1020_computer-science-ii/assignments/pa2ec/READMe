> A short description of any problems you encountered when writing this program, and how you solved the the problems you encountered.

* Overall syntax and structure of our class composition
   - Trial and error
* A ridiculous seg-fault that GDB couldn't help with, that seemed to indicate an issue with ofstream
   - Put <= instead of < in a for loops
* Thought I didn't understand how to use a function that returns bools
   - Put brackets w/ the array I had as the function parameter

> 3.	Your thoughts on the assignment.

I actually really liked it! Possibly giving us the whole spring break...
