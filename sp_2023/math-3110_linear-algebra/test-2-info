Ensure m and n legible
Explicitly say what rows and columns are variable wise
On note sheet, make all respective learning activities + study guide questions algorithmic
	* Emphasize shared ones 
	* Simplify equations as much as possible while retaining enough info for grading
	* Don't forget pre-class quizzes, lots of fundamentals there 
Color code by something
	* Perhaps seperate conditions, assignments, etc
Use textbook variables and clarify what each exactly is used for and not used for (for example can a scalar be 0? -1? No idea)
Need to find info quick, understand it quick, and execute it quick
