Interview process
	1. Determine people to interview
		* Client
			- Preliminary already involved middle managers and department heads
			- Should now interview people from all levels
			- Consult organization chart
			- Perhaps even people from outside organization (though prompt asking for client)
			- Look for informal structures not seen in org chart
			- Determine when group interviews should be used and what those groups would be
    2. Establish objectives for interview
    	* Determine general areas to discuss
    	* List facts to be gathered
    	* Soliciting ideas, suggestions, and opinions during interview good idea
    	* Objects differ based on person interviewed
    		- Upper-level mangement: Big picture to understand system as a whole
    		- Developers: Specific details about operations and business processes
    	* Objectives change as fact finding process evolves
    		- Farther in -> more specifics
    	* Should be as brief as possible but as long as needed 
	3. Develop questions
		* Create standard list of interview questions
			- Helps keep session on track and avoi dtangents
			- Lets you compare answers
			- Interviewer may depart from list because an answer to a previous Q leads to topic that warrants pursuing
				> Question should be included in revised set of questions for future interviews
				> If very important, query previous intervee about it
		* Open-ended questions
			- Examples
				> What are users saying about new system
				> How is this task performed
				> Why do you perform the task that way
				> How are the checks reconciled?
				> What added features would you like to have in the new billing system
			- Can be used to probe previous question further
				> "Is there anything else you can tell me about this topic?"
		* Close-ended questions
			- Limit or restrict response
			- Used when information that is more specific is needed or when facts must be verified
			- Examples
				> How many personal computers do you have in this department?
				> Do you review the reports before they are sent out?
				> How many hours of training does a clerk receive?
				> Is the calculation procedure described in the manual?
				> How many customers ordered products from the website last month?
		* Range-of-response Questions
			- Closed-ended questions
			- Ask person to evaluate something by providing limited answers to specific responses or on a numeric scale
			- Makes it easier to tabulate answers and interpret results\
			- Examples
				> On scale of 1-10, how effective was your training?
				> How would you rate the serverity of the problem: Low, medium, or high?
				> Is the system shutdown something that occurs never, sometimes, often, usually, or always?
