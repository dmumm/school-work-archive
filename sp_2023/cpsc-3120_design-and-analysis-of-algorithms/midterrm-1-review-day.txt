Review on algorithm / chapter 1.1:
	* What an algorithm is and notation used in questions
BigO / chapter 1.1:
	* First homework
	* How things grow in comparison to eachother
	* Big O rules and simplification, rules provided in question 
Amortized analysis 1.4:
	* Accountin method
	* Potential method
	* Previous hw / in class examples
	* Remember difference between worst case and amortized
		* Expect to answer what big O is for algorithm and then amortized 
Union find 7.1-7.2
	* List based
	* Tree based
		- Path compression 
	* By rank
	* By size
	* Perform series of operations with some potentially not given implementation 
	* Remember heuristics for find level and union level respectively 
Trees
	* AVL
		* Insert
		* Delete
		* Prove property
		* Show result of operation
	* RB
		* Removal not in any exam 
		* Prove property
		* Show result of operation 
	* Splay 
		* Insert
		* Delete
		* Will not need to prove a property

Don't hold back questions during exam
	* Please ask if youre interpreting questions correctly 

Questions:
* Can you use example to prove tree?
	- Only if you argue general case on top of it
	- Use generic variables 
* Tips for studying?
	- Think about small questions / exercises in lecture
	- Re-do them now without looking at solution 
* Is structure of exam similar to homework
	- Yes
	- Same style of questions
