Problems:

Checking Neighbors, even after figuring out the problem was checking non-board
values.
* I fixed it by just adding a ton of conditionals, but its messy.

Allocating memory without throwing errors in valgrind.
* Ended up using calloc.

Freeing memory
* I had i=height; i>0, needed i=height-1; i>=0

 Simply getting a clue on how to "propogateGuess". E
 * Ended up experimenting with trial and error until I made gradual progress

 Win state for option 4.
 * Ended up with a simple counter but I tried using pointers and stuff

Thoughts:

LOVED the assignment, super fun, and gives perspective as to how minesweeper
 works. Only issue was I think the .h file gave too much away.
